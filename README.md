Welcome to my unique personal portfolio! This is not just another web-based portfolio‚Äîit's a musical experience where you can get to know me while enjoying some tunes.

üåü Overview
In this portfolio, I‚Äôve designed a music player-themed experience where traditional sections like Education, Experience, Projects, and About Me are brought to life through music. Instead of simply reading through my information, users can now listen to custom songs that tell my story:

About Me - Get a melodic introduction to who I am.
Education - A track that summarizes my academic journey.
Experience - A song that highlights my professional experience.
Projects - An audio tour of my most notable projects.

üöÄ Features
Music Player Interface: Navigate through different sections like you would in a music app.
Custom Tracks: Enjoy four unique songs that give an insight into my background.
Engaging Design: A sleek, interactive interface with smooth transitions and a dark theme.
Responsive Layout: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

üéº How It Works
Click on the song for each section (About, Education, Experience, Projects).
Listen to the custom track as it narrates my journey.
Use the music player controls to pause, play, or skip sections.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Styled Components, Framer Motion for smooth animations.
Music Player: Custom-built using JavaScript and Web Audio API.
Responsive Design: Ensuring a seamless experience on all devices.
